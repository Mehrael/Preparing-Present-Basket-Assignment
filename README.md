# Preparing-Present-Basket-Assignment
A loving daughter decided to prepare a precious gift for her parents. She bought two baskets and decided to fill each basket with the most expensive fruits from the supermarket. Each basket can be filled with maximum weight.
In the supermarket; there're 'N' fruits. For each one, the supermarket displays the full remaining weights 'weights[i]' with their total costs 'costs[i]'. Design an efficient algorithm so that the daughter can fill her baskets with the most expensive collection of fruits.
